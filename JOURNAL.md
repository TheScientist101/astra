### Total hours:

* TheScientist101: 3
* grimsteel:  3

# May 23rd:

TheScientist101 + grimsteel

**Hours spent: 3 each (huddle)**

We decided the initial drone features.

We plan on making a laser tag drone:
- Each player will control their own drone. (We'll be manufacturing two for this.)
- The objective of the game will be for the drones to find and tag each other using the attached remote controllable laser and IR sensors.


Other features include semi-autonomous navigation as well as a camera for photos/FPV.

Our main concern is the thrust and the weight of the drone.

This is what we spent the majority of the time figuring out, but we learned a lot about aerodynamics.

We decided on an initial BOM, which is included in our [Full planning document](./PLANNING.md)
